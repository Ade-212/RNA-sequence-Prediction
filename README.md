# RNA-sequence-Prediction
# Description:
This is my attempt at creating my first solo Machine learning project by trying to predict the potential RNA sequence of the COVID-19 virus using the LSTM model which is an artificial neural network architectured used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Being able to predict the next RNA sequence of the COVID-19 virus can be crucial in the process of Vaccine design, Antiviral Drug Development, Diagnostics tests and many more applications as it gives reliable insights about the mutations we might face in the future

# Dependencies:
To run the notebook in this project, make sure to install the following libraries:

# Data Processing:
This Project reads in data about the confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries. This data is then processed and aggregated to offer insights on global trends.

# Notebook 2:
Read and preprocess the COVID-19 time series data.
Handle missing values and aggregate data
Combine confirmed, death, and recovery data into a single DataFrame.

# Notebook 6:
Extract RNA sequences from a given file and structure them into a pamdas DataFrame.

# Notebook 7:
Tokenize the RNA sequences, converting them into integer sequences for further processing.

# Notebook 8:
Split the RNA sequences into training and testing data for the machine learning model

# Visualization:
Visualized the trends in the provided data, This was essential for understanding the Nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and using this information to make informed decisions

# Notebook 3:
Plot aggregate metrics for confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries In specifically the United Kingdom.

# Notebook 4:
 plot metrics for mortality, recovery and growth rates worldwide.

 # Notebook 5:
 Visualize confirmed cases by country on a log scale.

# Model Building and Training:
This is the heart of the project and the part of the project i struggled with the most but also taught me the most about building Neural network models and just about the Fundamentals of Machine learning. This section uses TensorFlow to build, train and evaluate machine learning models on the provided data

# Notebook 9:
construct a Bidirectional LSTM network to predict RNA sequences.

# Notebook 10:
Save and visualize the model's architecture.

# Notebook 11
Train the LSTM model and evaluate its performance on a test datasaet.

# Notebook 12:
Visualize the model's training progress, including loss and accuracy metrics

# Notebook 13:
Construct a Transformer-based model to handle sequence data.

# Usage:
Clone the repository.
Install all required dependencies.
Run each Jupyter notebook in sequence, ensuring you understand each step.

# Future Work
Explore more complex model architectures for improved accuracy
incorporate more datasets to provide a richer set of insights
Implement real-time updating of the data for up-to-date predictions
