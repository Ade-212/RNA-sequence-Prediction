# RNA-sequence-Prediction
# Description:
This is my attempt at creating my first solo Machine learning project by trying to predict the potential RNA sequence of the COVID-19 virus using the LSTM model which is an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning. Being able to predict the next RNA sequence of the COVID-19 virus can be crucial in the process of Vaccine design, Antiviral Drug Development, Diagnostics tests and many more applications as it gives reliable insights about the mutations we might face in the future
# Dependencies
